3. <b>Write a function in Python that takes a list of strings and returns a single string that is an HTML unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;) of those strings.

4. <b>List 2-3 attacks that web applications are vulnerable to. How do these attacks work? How can we prevent those attacks?  
5. <b>Here is some starter code for a Flask Web Application. Expand on that and include a route that simulates rolling two dice and returns the result in JSON. You should include a brief explanation of your code.</b>
   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   app = Flask(__name__)

   import json
   import random

   @app.route('/')

     return 'Hello World!'
